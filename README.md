# tag-react-native

Please note that this is a deprecated version of Tag-AR. Once we realized it was important to use Cocoapods to link the various libraries that were required for this project, we decided as a team that we would need to not only refactor our code, but also set up a brand new repository. Please see our complete project, TagAR, at https://github.com/tag-digital-graffiti/TagAR to try our digital graffiti app, which allows users to upload and create drawings and project them in augmented reality.
